# Fake News Detection

## Overview
The Fake News Detection project is a machine learning project that aims to detect fake news articles from real news articles using an annotated dataset of news articles. The dataset consists of roughly half fake news articles and half real news articles. The project uses various NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data, such as removing stop words and lemmatization, before training the data with machine learning algorithms.
